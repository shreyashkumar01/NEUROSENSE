1. What is NEUROSENSE? 

NEUROSENSE is a mobile and web app that helps people recover after brain or nerve problems.

It is made for people who:

Had a stroke

Lost movement in hands or legs

Have Parkinson’s or brain injury

Have speech problems

Have learning difficulties or autism

Feel stressed, depressed, or anxious

👉 Instead of going to hospitals again and again, NEUROSENSE helps them do therapy at home using just a smartphone.
